# Members Only 

In this project, I implemented the authentication system using the Devise Gem so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to. Only signed-in users can write posts and can see who the author of a post is.

## Built With

- Ruby 2.6.5 and Rails 5.2.4.2
- Bootsrap 4 

## What it does?
An exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
